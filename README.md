# The Bed Brigade National Website

In 2023 we are developing a national website for The Bed Brigade.  Bed Brigade of Grove City, Ohio is a 501 3c registered charity.  Bed Brigade builds and delivers Twin XL beds to people in need.  80% of the beds delivered serve children that do not have a bed.  Several chapters of Bed Brigade opened up throughout Ohio in 2022.  There is a need  for a national website for all Bed Brigade Chapters to use. 
See the this page for more information about Bed Brigade: https://www.bedbrigadecolumbus.org/about-us
 
This is the current website that runs in Orchard Core:
https://www.bedbrigadecolumbus.org/

The national web site will be built in Blazor Web Assembly for the front end and a .NET Core API for the back end.  .NET Core 7 will be used.
