Here is a sample method that demonstrates how to remove the geolocation metadata from an image in C#:

Copy code
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;

public void RemoveGeolocation(string filePath)
{
    // Load the image from the file
    using (Image image = Image.FromFile(filePath))
    {
        // Remove the EXIF property with the GPS tag
        image.RemovePropertyItem(0x0000);

        // Save the image back to the file
        image.Save(filePath);
    }
}
This method uses the System.Drawing namespace to load the image from the file, and the Image class to remove the EXIF property with the GPS tag. The RemovePropertyItem method takes the property ID of the EXIF property to remove as an argument. In this case, the property ID for the GPS tag is 0x0000.

After removing the property, the method saves the image back to the file using the original file path.

Note that this method assumes that the image file exists and contains geolocation metadata. You may want to add error handling to handle cases where the file does not exist or does not contain the expected metadata.
