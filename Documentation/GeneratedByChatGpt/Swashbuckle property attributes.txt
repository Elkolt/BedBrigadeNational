To define descriptions for fields in a model class using Swashbuckle in an ASP.NET Core application, you can follow these steps:

Install the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations NuGet package in your project.

In your model class, use the [Description] attribute from the Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations namespace to specify the description for each field. For example:

Copy code
public class CreateUserModel
{
    [Required]
    [StringLength(100)]
    [Description("The name of the user.")]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [StringLength(200)]
    [Description("The email address of the user.")]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
Run your ASP.NET Core application and navigate to the Swagger UI (usually at http://localhost:<port>/swagger). The descriptions for the fields in the model class will be reflected in the Swagger specification.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
