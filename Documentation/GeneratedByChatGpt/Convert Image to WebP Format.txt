Here is a sample method that demonstrates how to convert an image to webp format in C# and save it to a file:

Copy code
using System.IO;
using System.Drawing;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.WebP;

public string ConvertToWebP(string filePath)
{
    // Load the image from the file
    using (Image image = Image.FromFile(filePath))
    {
        // Generate a new file path for the webp image
        string webpFilePath = Path.ChangeExtension(filePath, ".webp");

        // Save the image to the new file in webp format
        using (FileStream output = File.OpenWrite(webpFilePath))
        {
            image.Save(output, new WebPEncoder());
        }

        // Return the file path to the webp image
        return webpFilePath;
    }
}
This method uses the System.Drawing namespace to load the image from the file, and the SixLabors.ImageSharp library to save the image in webp format. The WebPEncoder class from the SixLabors.ImageSharp.Formats.WebP namespace is used to encode the image in webp format.

Note that this method assumes that the image file exists and is in a format that can be loaded by the Image.FromFile method. You may want to add error handling to handle cases where the file does not exist or is not a valid image file.
