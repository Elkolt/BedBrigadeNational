To use Serilog in C# to output to a file, the console, SQLite, and SQL Server, you can follow these steps:

Install the following NuGet packages in your C# project:
Serilog
Serilog.Sinks.File
Serilog.Sinks.Console
Serilog.Sinks.SQLite
Serilog.Sinks.MSSqlServer
In your C# code, configure Serilog to output to the desired destinations using the WriteTo method. For example:
Copy code
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.File("log.txt")
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.SQLite("log.db")
    .WriteTo.MSSqlServer(
        connectionString: "Server=localhost;Database=Log;User Id=sa;Password=password;",
        tableName: "Logs")
    .CreateLogger();
This will configure Serilog to output log events to a file named log.txt, the console, a SQLite database file named log.db, and a SQL Server database.

You can customize the output formatting and other options for each sink by using the available configuration methods. For example, you can use the MinimumLevel method to specify the minimum log level that should be output to a sink, and the Enrich method to enrich the log events with additional properties.

Once you have configured Serilog, you can use it to log events in your C# code using the Log class. For example:

Copy code
Log.Information("Hello, world!");
This will log an event with the message "Hello, world!" at the Information level.
